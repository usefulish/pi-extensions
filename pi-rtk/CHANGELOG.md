# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (2026-08-31)

### Changed

- find-predicate blocklist is now version-gated: rtk ≥ 0.46 dispatches on find's
  grammar and passes unmodeled predicates through to real find (never-worse
  guard), so `-not/!/-or/-o/-and/-a/-newer/-perm/-size/-mtime/-mmin/-atime/
  -amin/-ctime/-cmin/-empty/-link` and `(` `)` groups rewrite again (round-trip
  verified against native find). rtk < 0.46 keeps the old strict blocklist.
- Always rejected regardless of version: `-exec/-execdir/-delete/-print0/
  -fprint0/-fprintf/-fprint/-regex/-iregex/-regextype` (mutating or consumer-
  contract tokens where rtk's compact display is lossy).

### Added

- `npm test` script (`node --test`) — findFallback tests were present but never
  run by CI's `npm pack --dry-run`.

### Fixed

- Version-gate helpers live in a new `version-gate.js` module instead of new
  exports in `findFallback.js`: pi's jiti loader can pair a reloaded `index.ts`
  with a stale cached copy of an existing module, which crashed at import
  (`parseSemver is not a function`). New imports must target new files.
