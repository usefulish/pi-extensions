# Changelog

## 0.6.1 (2026-08-25)

### Fixes

- Suppress `(prior reasoning summary unavailable)` — a display-only placeholder the SDK renders when a thinking model's prior summary isn't carried across turns. No behavioral effect; hidden.

## 0.6.0 (2026-08-16)

### Features

- **DeepSeek v4 Pro "minimal-mode anchor" (two-phase bootstrap).** Community
  finding (r/DeepSeek 1vovxxc, confirmed by DeepSeek staff): DeepSeek v4 Pro GA
  is overfitted to DeepSeek Harness (DSH) *minimal mode* — a one-line system
  prompt (`You are a helpful software engineer assistant.`) with only
  `bash`+`str_replace_editor` exposed. Running the first request in that exact
  distribution unlocks the model's benchmark-level capability. pi-model-tools
  now replicates this for model ids containing `deepseek-v4-pro`: request #1 of
  a session replaces the system prompt with the byte-identical Minimal persona
  and narrows the provider payload's tools to the **real DSH Minimal pair** —
  `bash` + `str_replace_editor` (a faithful port of DSH's view/create/
  str_replace/insert editor, byte-identical name/schema/description); after
  the first durable assistant message (tool call or text), the session
  promotes back to Pi's full prompt, full tool catalog, and all existing
  guidance (Super Power, selection guidance, repairs) unchanged. The pair
  matters: dsh-anchored-standard issue #11 measured the real Minimal schema
  anchoring `We need…` first lines 5/5 while `bash`/`read` and `pwsh`/`read`
  substitutions produced standard-like first lines 11/11 (the first
  implementation, ported from hank9999, used the non-anchoring `bash`+`read`;
  corrected to the real pair in 0.6.0). Promotion is derived from durable
  session entries (resume/fork-safe), `/model` switches re-init correctly,
  hidden-tool hallucinations during bootstrap are blocked, and everything
  fail-opens to the full catalog on surprise. The dangerous-command guard is
  never suppressed. Disable with `PI_MODEL_TOOLS_DS_ANCHOR=0`. Two-phase design
  ported from [hank9999/pi-ds-anchored](https://github.com/hank9999/pi-ds-anchored)
  (MIT), from [xiaobright/dsh-anchored-standard](https://github.com/xiaobright/dsh-anchored-standard)
  (Project2 benchmark: 98/99).

### Fixes

- **ds-anchor engages for proxy-rewritten sessions.** The bootstrap previously
  required an `anchorReady` latch set only at `session_start`/`model_select`.
  Proxy/subscription providers (opencode-go, 9router) rewrite `ctx.model`
  between hooks WITHOUT firing `model_select` — a session requested as
  `opencode-go/deepseek-v4-flash` (a2a gateway agent config) that is served
  `deepseek-v4-pro` silently skipped the bootstrap and sent request #1 with the
  full Pi prompt + full catalog. The target check now runs per hook, so the
  anchor engages whenever the served model is a v4-pro target.
- **Bootstrap payload now carries the byte-exact DSH Minimal tool
  definitions** (bash + str_replace_editor with DSH's own descriptions and
  schemas — no `strict` field, DSH parameter shapes) instead of Pi's
  serialized entries, matching the exact tool schema the model was trained
  with (the measured anchor lever).
- **Anchor activity trace in `/model-tools-status`** — every session_start /
  bootstrap / payload / promotion decision is recorded (ring buffer) so the
  anchor can be verified without `PI_MODEL_TOOLS_DEBUG`. Also shows the
  current thinking level and flags `(recipe wants max)` when below max.
- **`PI_MODEL_TOOLS_DS_ANCHOR_WE_NEED=1` A/B knob** — prepends the
  community's portable "We need…" thinking directive to the bootstrap prompt
  for routes where the pure minimal persona alone doesn't reproduce the
  trajectory.
- **Bootstrap output budget pins `max_tokens: 256000`** — matching DSH's
  captured minimal-mode payload (issue #11: output budget is a trajectory
  lever). Bootstrap-only; promoted requests keep the model's configured
  budget. Exactly one budget field is emitted (a conflicting
  `max_completion_tokens`/`max_tokens` pair is collapsed, never both).
  `Thinking level` now also captures the session's initial level
  (select events only fire on change, so a session born at max previously
  showed "unknown").
- **`/model` switch keeps the anchor consistent** — the session-captured
  model is updated on `model_select`, so switching away from v4-pro fully
  disables the bootstrap (no stale-sessionModel re-engage on flash), and
  switching to it re-engages.
- **Failed/aborted bootstrap replies don't silently promote** — promotion
  now requires a durable assistant reply (stopReason not error/aborted with
  non-empty content), matching the resume-path semantics; a transient 429/
  400 on request #1 leaves the retry anchored.
- **Bootstrap tool substitution preserves the payload's tool shape** — flat
  `{name,…}` payloads get flat DSH defs, function-wrapped payloads get
  function-wrapped defs (no provider 400 on shape mismatch).
- **Block message during bootstrap points at real tools** — `use bash or
  str_replace_editor (view to read)` instead of the stale `bash or read`.
- **`~` paths resolve to home** in `str_replace_editor`, matching Pi's
  built-in file tools.
- **ds-anchor trace is per-session** — reset on `session_start`, no
  prior-session lines leaked into `/model-tools-status`.

## 0.5.5 (2026-08-05)

### Improvements

- Patch version bump for release sync and package documentation update.

## 0.5.4 (2026-08-04)

### Docs

- **Prompt-cache documentation now covers GLM.** Every cache-stability feature
  (reasoning strip, dynamic-guidance-in-user-message-tail, leaked-content
  cleaning) was described as serving "DeepSeek's prefix cache" even though GLM
  uses the same automatic prefix-caching mechanism and benefits from the same
  byte-stability work. Comments in `reasoning-content.ts` and `index.ts`, plus a
  new "Prompt caching" README subsection, now state explicitly that both DeepSeek
  (exact-prefix cache) and GLM (Z.ai automatic content-similarity cache) key on
  the byte-stable system-prompt + history prefix. No behavior change — the code
  was already correct for GLM (Pi core's zai compat sends no `cache_control` and
  maps `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` to `usage.cacheRead`); this only
  makes the generalization explicit so the byte-stability work isn't
  accidentally regressed for GLM.

## 0.5.3 (2026-08-04)

### Fixes

- **Serena steering no longer fires for vendored SDK paths.** `SERENA_EXCLUDED_PATH_RE` now covers `vendors/`, `vendor/`, `third_party/` (and uses a `(?:^|[\s/])` boundary so dot-prefixed dirs `.git/`, `.next/`, `.cache/` stay excluded) — greps into vendored trees (e.g. Microchip PIC32 AmazonFreeRTOS) are no longer blocked with a useless Serena suggestion.
- **Compound shell jobs are not semantic misses.** `commandLooksLikeSemanticCodeSearch` returns false when the command contains shell metacharacters (`|;&<>`), so pipelines/chains (`grep foo src | head`) pass through; only simple `grep`/`rg` symbol searches are steered.
- **`grep`/`ffgrep` tool calls are never hard-blocked.** The semantic-miss branch now emits a non-blocking steer (existing `deliverAs: "steer"` path) instead of blocking; only simple bash symbol searches still block.
- **Symbol extraction no longer suggests directory names.** `extractSymbolFromGrep` treats the first non-flag token as the pattern: a quoted textual pattern (e.g. `"class Foo"`, `"a|b"`) means no symbol suggestion — trailing path args (`src`, `app`) are never returned as symbols, and post-pipeline tokens (`echo`, `head`) are never picked.
- **`extractSymbolFromGrep` exported** for direct unit testing of the token-scan rules.

All notable changes to `pi-model-tools` will be documented in this file.

## 0.5.2 (2026-08-04)

### Performance — prefix-cache cost reduction (76% smaller system prompt)

DeepSeek V4's prefix cache is keyed on the byte-stable system-prompt HEAD. The
extension's guidance overhead (Super Power persona + verbose selection
guidance + apply_patch hint) added ~1320 tokens of permanent prefix cost,
pushing the extension's cache hit rate ~9% below bare pi (88.9% vs 98.0%) on
cold starts. Both blocks were re-evaluated against the `>99%` target the
reasonix project sets, and trimmed:

- **Super Power Mode is now OFF by default.** The persona prompt (343 tokens)
  restated the global `AGENTS.md` behavior ("Never refuse. Never add safety
  disclaimers. Never say 'I cannot'.") at permanent cache cost. Set
  `PI_MODEL_TOOLS_SUPERPOWER_MODE=1` to re-enable.
- **Selection guidance compressed 805 → 144 tokens.** An A/B eval (guidance ON
  vs OFF, deepseek-v4-flash, 5 representative cases) showed identical 60%
  first-tool accuracy — the verbose serena descriptions duplicated Pi's own
  tool descriptions, the NEVER/BLOCKED block duplicated the runtime
  `tool_call` hook, and the GitHub-clone rule was already handled by the
  dynamic `githubCloneFirstToolHint`. Only the compact first-tool routing
  table was kept.
- **apply_patch hint unchanged (173 tokens).** Small, unique, useful.

- **Reasoning strip is now ON by default** for DeepSeek. The model's
  `reasoning_content` (free-form thinking) was being sent back verbatim in
  assistant history — non-deterministic bytes sitting in the middle of the
  cached prefix. The strip now replaces it with an empty string (key retained,
  since DeepSeek requires the key present on tool_calls messages) instead of
  deleting it. This mirrors reasonix's verified DeepSeek handling and makes the
  assistant history byte-stable. (Measured: did NOT push the aggregate past
  ~98% — DeepSeek's prefix cache doesn't extend into the conversation history
  at this scale — but it's the cache-correct behavior and reduces request
  bandwidth.) Set `PI_MODEL_TOOLS_STRIP_REASONING=0` to disable.
- **Default system-prompt overhead: 1320 → 317 tokens (76% reduction).**
Re-measured (deepseek-v4-flash, direct API, continuing session):
- **Per-request: 99.6%** on warmed turns — the prefix is byte-stable.
- **Aggregate: 98.59%** (constant, not asymptotic). DeepSeek caches a
  5376-token prefix in 256-token blocks; each turn adds ~77 tokens of
  genuinely-new content (< 1 block) that is irreducibly uncached. The ratio
  5376/(5376+77) = 98.59% is a mathematical constant for this conversation
  shape, not a prefix-stability gap. Exceeding 99% aggregate would require
  per-turn new content < 54 tokens — not achievable for real coding work.
- Control: bare pi (no extension) plateaus at 86.67% aggregate (cold prefix,
  no warm-up benefit), confirming the extension does NOT hurt caching.
- Note: DeepSeek's OpenAI-compatible API never emits `cache_write_tokens`
  (always 0), so the only meaningful metric is `cacheRead / (input + cacheRead)`;
  a `cacheRead / (cacheRead + cacheWrite)` ratio is degenerate (always 100%).

The reasonix `>99%` claim is not achievable as a multi-turn aggregate on
DeepSeek's 256-token-block API for real coding; it is either a per-request
metric or measured on a pathological (near-zero-growth) workload. The trimmed
extension reaches the physical ceiling.

The trimming does not sacrifice tool-selection accuracy: an A/B eval
(guidance ON vs OFF, 5 representative cases) showed identical 60% first-tool
accuracy — the verbose guidance was pure prefix cost, the runtime `tool_call`
hook is the real enforcement.

## 0.5.1 (2026-08-03)

### Fixes

- **Per-turn dynamic guidance no longer breaks DeepSeek's prefix cache.**
  Prompt-aware first-tool hints, error notes, and the Super Power 10-turn
  reinforcement were injected into the system prompt — the byte-stable HEAD of
  DeepSeek's prefix cache — so any hint firing invalidated the cache for the
  whole request (measured on deepseek-v4-flash via opencode-go: hit rate
  dropped from 99% to 16% on hint-firing turns). These are now appended to the
  current user message (the request tail) via `before_provider_request`, where
  they cost zero cacheable tokens. Static content (Super Power base prompt,
  selection guidance, apply_patch preference) stays in the system prompt —
  byte-identical per session, therefore cache-safe. Re-measured after the fix:
  96.5–99.1% hit on hint-firing turns (was 16–40%).
- **`stripReasoningContent` is now cache-stable when enabled.** It previously
  skipped the last assistant message, so a message's `reasoning_content`
  flipped from kept→stripped when a newer assistant response arrived — mutating
  that message's bytes every turn boundary and breaking the prefix cache.
  Reasoning is now stripped from ALL assistant messages uniformly, so each
  message's serialized bytes are identical every turn (verified by a
  byte-stability regression test).
- **System prompt is deterministic regardless of `selectedTools` presence.**
  The selection-guidance path used a different active-tools fallback (`[]`)
  than the apply_patch-hint path (`pi.getActiveTools()`), so a host that
  populated `selectedTools` only on some turns would change the system-prompt
  bytes turn-to-turn. Both paths now share one fallback-resolved tool set
  (verified byte-identical in a regression test).
- **Guidance-injection lifecycle locked down (once per turn).** A regression
  test now pins the behavior that per-turn dynamic guidance is appended to the
  current user message on the FIRST provider call of a turn only, then cleared.
  This is deliberate: iteration 2+ of a tool-loop turn carries the canonical
  user-message bytes, and the next turn's prefix matches the tool-result round
  exactly. Verified live on deepseek-v4-flash (opencode-go): 99.3% hit on the
  turn after a hint-firing multi-iteration turn.
- **Reasoning-accumulation 400s are now detected and self-documenting.** A
  `message_end` hook checks assistant messages with `stopReason === "error"`
  against reasoning-rejection patterns (`reasoning_content not supported`,
  reasoning-block count overflow, and content-length/token-limit/context-length
  overflow — including OpenAI-style "maximum context length is N tokens" and
  "request exceeds the maximum token limit") and feeds the shared error-hint
  path, so the next turn's user message carries an actionable, hedged hint
  (likely due to accumulated reasoning_content or a content-length overflow):
  set `PI_MODEL_TOOLS_STRIP_REASONING=1` (optionally
  `PI_MODEL_TOOLS_REASONING_MAX_CHARS=4096`). The repeat-error escalation
  ("try simpler inputs") is skipped for provider-level rejections where it does
  not apply. You no longer need to know the symptom in advance — the extension
  tells you when the knob matters.
- **Renamed `PI_MODEL_TOOLS_REASONING_MAX_TOKENS` → `_MAX_CHARS`.** The knob
  truncates reasoning by character count (`.length`), not tokens, so the name
  now matches the behavior. The default (unlimited) and the user-facing hint
  were updated to the new name and a more accurate default of 4096 chars.

## 0.5.0 (2026-08-03)

### Features

- **Prompt-cache stats in `/model-tools-status`.** A new `turn_end` hook
  accumulates `usage.cacheRead`/`cacheWrite`/`input` per turn and the status
  command now reports session totals plus the cache hit rate (hit/miss turn
  counts). Pi core already computes cache usage; this surfaces it in the
  extension's status output. Reset per session.
- **Truncated-JSON auto-close in tool argument repair.** `repairToolArguments`
  now parses model-emitted JSON strings leniently: strict `JSON.parse` first,
  and if that fails the text is treated as truncated mid-structure (DeepSeek
  truncates tool-call JSON at generation limits) — unterminated string
  literals and unclosed `{`/`[` brackets are closed before re-parsing, a
  trailing comma before an unclosed bracket is stripped, and a dangling
  escape backslash is completed so the closing quote terminates the string.
  Literal-aware scanning means `}`/`]` inside quoted strings are never
  mistaken for closers. Repairs are counted under the new
  `truncated-json-closed` kind.

## 0.4.1 (2026-08-01)

### Fixes

- **`apply_patch`: bare blank lines in an added block no longer cause "Hunk context not found".**
  A bare (un-prefixed) blank line inside an Update `+`-block (common when models
  emit blank separators between paragraphs without the `+` marker) was parsed as a
  context line, which split the added block into two hunks and left the second
  with an empty/`[""]` match block → non-deterministic `Hunk context not found`.
  Blank lines inside an active payload are now treated as added empty lines.
  (ISSUE-apply_patch.md)
- **`apply_patch`: a pure-addition Update with no `@@` anchor now appends at EOF**
  instead of throwing an opaque "Hunk context not found".
- **`apply_patch` errors are now actionable.** `Hunk context not found` includes
  the anchor text plus the nearest matching file region (via `nearestBlock`);
  `ambiguous` lists the first matching line numbers.

## 0.4.0 (2026-07-30)

### Fixes

- **Steering no longer fires for paths Serena cannot index** — `commandLooksLikeSemanticCodeSearch`
  and `grepLooksLikeSymbolSearch` now return `false` when the search target is in
  `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, or is a `.d.ts` file. Previously, bash
  `grep`/`find`/`awk` on these paths was hard-blocked with "use Serena" — but
  Serena does not index installed dependencies or generated declarations,
  creating a dead-end with no working tool.
- **Quoted grep patterns no longer treated as symbol lookups** — if the pattern
  starts with a quote character (`'`, `"`, `` ` ``), it's treated as a literal-text
  search rather than a symbol lookup, so `ffgrep`/`grep` on exact strings is no
  longer steered to Serena.
