# pi-hub

Interactive installer for [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) packages — browse, search, and install pi extensions without typing `pi install ...`.

Inspired by [vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/skills): one command, interactive multi-select, sensible defaults.

Current version: **0.1.3**

## Quick start

```bash
npx @bacnh85/pi-hub
```

That's it — you get the full catalog of `@bacnh85` extensions with descriptions, navigate with arrow keys, press `space` to select, `a` to select all, then `enter` to install. Each selection runs `pi install npm:<package>` for you.

Requirements: Node ≥ 20 and the [`pi` CLI](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) on PATH (`pi --version` must work).

## Commands

### `pi-hub` (no arguments) — interactive browser

```bash
npx @bacnh85/pi-hub
```

- Lists all 32 curated `@bacnh85` packages with full-width descriptions
- `↑`/`↓` move · `space` toggle · `a` toggle all · `enter` confirm · `q` quit
- The detail line under the list shows the full npm name + description of the highlighted package
- On confirm, prints what will be installed, then runs `pi install` per package (passes through pi's own output)
- Add `-y` to skip the confirmation, `-l` to install project-local instead of user-scope

### `add` — install without browsing

```bash
npx @bacnh85/pi-hub add pi-plan              # curated shorthand → npm:@bacnh85/pi-plan
npx @bacnh85/pi-hub add pi-plan pi-munin     # multiple packages
npx @bacnh85/pi-hub add @bacnh85/pi-review   # scoped npm name
npx @bacnh85/pi-hub add user/repo            # any git repo → git:github.com/user/repo
npx @bacnh85/pi-hub add npm:@foo/pi-tools    # passthrough, exactly as pi install expects
npx @bacnh85/pi-hub add pi-plan -l           # -l = project-local (.pi/settings.json)
```

Unknown first arguments are treated as `add` too: `npx @bacnh85/pi-hub pi-plan` works.

| Input | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| `pi-plan` | `npm:@bacnh85/pi-plan` (curated catalog lookup) |
| `@scope/pkg` | `npm:@scope/pkg` |
| `owner/repo` | `git:github.com/owner/repo` |
| `npm:…`, `git:…`, `https://…`, `ssh://…` | passthrough to `pi install` |

### `find` — search

```bash
npx @bacnh85/pi-hub find memory              # curated matches first, then npm at large
npx @bacnh85/pi-hub find plan --json         # machine-readable output
```

Searches the curated catalog (name + description), then the npm registry for Pi's official `keywords:pi-package` convention. Offline or rate-limited? It gracefully falls back to the catalog only.

### `list` — what's installed

```bash
npx @bacnh85/pi-hub list
```

Reads `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` and shows installed package sources.

### `remove` — uninstall

```bash
npx @bacnh85/pi-hub remove pi-plan           # resolve shorthand → pi remove npm:@bacnh85/pi-plan
npx @bacnh85/pi-hub remove                   # no args: removes all user-scope npm: packages
```

### `update` — update installed packages

```bash
npx @bacnh85/pi-hub update                   # runs pi update --extensions
```

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-l, --local` | project-local install (`.pi/settings.json`) instead of user scope |
| `-y, --yes` | skip confirmation |
| `--json` | machine-readable output (`find`) |
| `-h, --help` | help |

## How it works

pi-hub is a thin discovery + selection layer **on top of the `pi` CLI** — `pi install` / `pi remove` do the actual package management, pi-hub never reimplements it. Sources:

- **Curated catalog** — the `@bacnh85` monorepo packages, bundled as `catalog.json`.
- **General discovery** — npm registry search for `keywords:pi-package`, Pi's official package convention. Falls back to catalog-only when offline.

`@bacnh85/pi-hub` itself is not a pi package (nothing registers into the agent); it's a standalone zero-dependency CLI.

## Workflow examples

```bash
# Set up a new machine with the full @bacnh85 stack
npx @bacnh85/pi-hub          # press 'a', then 'enter'

# Just the essentials for coding
npx @bacnh85/pi-hub add pi-plan pi-serena pi-subagent pi-review pi-munin

# Explore what the community published
npx @bacnh85/pi-hub find obsidian
npx @bacnh85/pi-hub find memory --json | jq '.[].name'

# Project-local install (shared with your team via .pi/settings.json)
npx @bacnh85/pi-hub add pi-permission -l
```

## Troubleshooting

- **`pi` not found on PATH** — install Pi first: `npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` (see [pi's README](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi)). pi-hub checks `pi --version` before anything else.
- **Picker doesn't respond to keys** — stdin must be a TTY. If you're piping input, use `add` instead of the interactive browser.
- **npm search returns nothing** — you're offline or rate-limited; curated catalog still works.
- **Install succeeded but extension not loaded** — run `pi config` to enable it, and `pi list` to verify the install.
