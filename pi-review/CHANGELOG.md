# Changelog

## 0.2.9 (2026-08-29)

### Added

- `/review` argument completion offers the thinking-level keywords
  (`off...max`) before the free-form target.

## 0.2.8 (2026-08-05)

### Improvements

- Patch version bump for release sync and package documentation update.

## 0.2.7 (2026-08-04)

### Fixes

- **`sort -o` detection covers combined short flags.** `DESTRUCTIVE_BASH_PATTERNS` now matches `sort -no out.txt` / `sort -on out.txt` (not just standalone `-o`), closing a review-mode gate escape where `sort` with an embedded output flag was treated as read-only.
- **`serena_check_onboarding_performed` added to `SAFE_REVIEW_TOOLS`** (mirrors `READ_ONLY_TOOLS`), so the read-only onboarding check is available during review.

All notable changes to `pi-review` will be documented in this file.
