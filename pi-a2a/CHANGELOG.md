# Changelog

## 0.7.2 (2026-08-30)

### Fixed

- **A reply-window timeout is no longer reported as SUCCESS.** When the
  inbound reply window expired, the session runner aborted the child session
  but still resolved normally, so `message/send` took the success path and
  returned `TASK_STATE_COMPLETED` with a truncated reply artifact — a killed
  worker and a finished one were indistinguishable at the protocol level. The
  runner now throws when the abort fired before the turn completed (captured
  at race settlement, so an abort landing during cleanup does not fail a
  completed turn), and `messageSend` independently routes any post-abort
  normal return through the failure classification: `TASK_STATE_FAILED` for a
  reply-window timeout (with a descriptive status message), `TASK_STATE_CANCELED`
  for user cancellation. `TASK_STATE_COMPLETED` is reserved for turns that
  actually finished, and a canceled task's state is no longer clobbered back
  to COMPLETED by a runner that returns normally on abort.

## 0.7.1 (2026-08-29)

### Added

- Slash-argument autocomplete: `/a2a-send` offers configured/discovered peer
  names (first token only), `/a2a-broadcast` offers `--agents`, and
  `/a2a-server` offers `start|stop|status`.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-08-22

### Changed

- **Config panel kernel extracted to `@bacnh85/pi-config-panel`.** The
  generic TUI shell (`PanelRow`/`PanelGroup`/`PanelAction`, `ConfigPanelModel`,
  `openConfigPanel`, inline editing, masking, group windowing) now lives in a
  shared library package; pi-a2a keeps only its A2A row builder (`buildRows`)
  and opens the panel via `openPanel()`. No behavior change — the kernel is
  byte-identical apart from the configurable panel `title`.

## 0.6.3 — 2026-08-21

### Changed

- **Agent Card skills are now self-discovered** from the live session instead
  of requiring manual `server.skills` config. The card lists every loaded
  skill (user `~/.pi/agent/skills`, project `.pi/skills`, and
  extension-package skills) via the host's command registry — the same list
  that drives `/skill:<name>` invocation. `server.skills` in config still wins
  when set (backward compat); with no skills discoverable the card falls back
  to the previous default `coding` skill. The local-registry descriptor and
  gateway registration use the same live list.

## 0.6.2 — 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **a2a-switchboard registration conflicts:** caller tokens are now persisted
  per gateway key *and* Pi peer name, so concurrent or port-changing Pi
  sessions cannot overwrite one another's management credential and trigger
  a `409` on their next heartbeat. Matching pre-0.6.2 state files are read once
  and migrated on the next token write. Graceful deregistration now also uses
  the peer caller token, as required by current switchboard versions.
- **Reverse channel opened with the shared token (HTTP 403):** switchboard
  issue #3 makes the per-peer `caller_token` the only accepted credential for
  `GET /channel` once one exists; `ChannelClient` now inherits the minted
  caller token from `GatewayUpstream` instead of the shared token.
- **Dedicated per-session inbound token (a2a-switchboard deployments):**
  gateway entries without an explicit `upstreamToken` now mint a fresh
  `agw-…` token per server start, register it as the peer's `upstream_token`
  and accept it inbound via `peerTokens`. The static `sharedToken` no longer
  leaves this machine — the switchboard presents the per-session token when
  proxying to us.
- **Reviewer follow-up fixes (all 6 findings):** minted tokens live in a
  server-side `mintedInboundTokens` map consulted via `authenticate()`'s new
  `extraTokens` (lookup-only — never flips `localhostOnly`, never required
  for anonymous loopback peers); per-entry identity keys so two unnamed
  gateway entries can't overwrite each other's token; the 409 self-heal
  rename now removes the pre-rename state file, `stateFile` follows the live
  name, and the server publishes `upstream.registeredName` (post-rename) for
  X-Gateway-Caller attribution; `classifyLine` checks ✎/completed/failed
  prefixes before the multi-line heuristic; `ChannelClient.stop()` dead
  no-op wait removed.
- **Epoch-guard race (review round 3):** `register()` re-checks the epoch
  AFTER the response body parse, so a `stop()` landing during that await can
  no longer resurrect state (un-stop the instance, refill the gateway peer
  overlay after `stop()` cleared it); `refreshPeers()` guards on the
  register-captured epoch.
- **Faster `/reload` and shutdown:** gateway deregistration now runs in
  parallel across upstreams and the best-effort `DELETE /register` timeout
  dropped 3s → 1.5s.
- **Channel-open status line names the peer:**
  `[a2a] gateway channel open: <gateway> as <peer-name> (firewall-safe
  receive)` — matching the registration line's `as <name>` style, so the
  session's registered peer name is visible without `/a2a-status`.
- **Class-colored A2A activity (UX):** inbound lines now read as a
  conversation, not a flat log — ⚑ **warning** for *received from peer* (like
  a user turn, distinct color), ⚙ **dim** for *executing tools* mid-answer,
  ✎ **success** for the *reply being sent back*, ✓ **success** / ✗ **error**
  for completion. Outbound replies are prefixed `[A2A → <peer> · context …]`
  so both directions are recognizable at a glance.
- **Self-healing initial-registration 409:** if the port-derived peer name is
  already held by a stale entry from a previous session (which the switchboard
  cannot re-issue a caller token for), the first `POST /register` now retries
  once with a unique name suffix so registration succeeds without manual
  switchboard cleanup.

## 0.6.1 — 2026-08-17

### Security

- **Per-identity task ownership (#10).** Every inbound task is stamped with the
  authenticated caller's identity at creation; `tasks/get`, `tasks/list`,
  `tasks/cancel`, and `tasks/subscribe` now only see/act on the caller's own
  tasks. A peer can no longer enumerate other peers' task ids, read their
  artifacts/replies, or cancel their tasks in per-peer-token deployments.
  Foreign tasks return the same `-32001 task not found` as missing ones (no
  existence leak).
- **GET endpoints authenticated (#9).** The enriched Agent Card (pid, cwd,
  model, session metadata via `discovery.enrichCard`) is now served only to
  authenticated callers; anonymous callers get the plain card so discovery
  keeps working. `/metrics` requires authentication (401 otherwise).
- **Push secret fails closed (#11).** `getPushSecret()` no longer falls back to
  the hardcoded `"pi-a2a-push-default"` — without a configured `sharedToken`
  there is no signing secret (`null`), so push-payload HMACs are no longer
  forgeable by anyone. Push delivery is currently unwired, so no behavior
  change beyond the removed landmine.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-08-16

### Added

- **Multiple a2a-switchboard gateway upstreams.** New
  `discovery.gateways` map (`{ <key>: {enabled,url,token,name?,upstreamToken?,heartbeatSec?,channel?} }`)
  registers this session with N gateways at once — each registers, heartbeats,
  opens its reverse channel, and refreshes its peer-directory overlay
  independently. The legacy single `discovery.gateway` block (settings or env)
  keeps working and coexists.
- **`/a2a-config` Gateways group**: per-gateway rows (enabled/url/token/name/
  upstreamToken/heartbeat/channel, tokens masked) plus `+ Add gateway` /
  `− Remove gateway` actions (key must match `[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,64}`).
- Per-gateway registration names for `X-Gateway-Caller` attribution.

### Changed (breaking)

- **Gateway proxy peers are now ALWAYS namespaced by gateway key:**
  `gw/<name>` → `gw/<key>/<name>`. The legacy `gateway` block uses a key
  derived from its URL host-port (e.g. `gw/127.0.0.1-9920/<name>`); map keys
  are used verbatim. Old `gw/<name>` call names no longer resolve — use the
  `gateways` map with a stable key for predictable names.
- **SSRF pinning for gateway peers is per-peer:** each overlay peer carries its
  publishing gateway origin, so calls stay pinned even when the live config has
  no gateway block.
- **Gateway notifications are gateway-specific:** every status/diagnostic line
  now names the gateway — `[a2a] registered to a2a-switchboard <key>@<host> as
  <name>`, `[a2a] gateway channel open: <key>@<host> (firewall-safe receive)`,
  and `[a2a-gateway:<key>@<host>] …` for failures — so multi-gateway sessions
  are unambiguous.

### Fixed

- Stopping one gateway upstream no longer clears the other gateways' overlay
  peers (per-gateway overlay slices).

## 0.5.1 — 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- **Group-coherent config panel windowing:** the `/a2a-config` panel used to
  cut a category mid-way when the list scrolled (a group header could render
  with only some of its rows, looking detached). It now renders whole groups
  only — header + all its rows — and the window slides one group at a time.
  The first screen shows SERVER + DISCOVERY together, the next all remaining
  groups, so categories display like the settings.json structure.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- **Reviewer follow-up (PR#12 round 2):** closed 7 review findings on the
  security fixes themselves:
  - `ctx.settings` a2a blocks are now sanitized too (the top-precedence
    branch bypassed the repo-file guard; dead code today — the SDK's
    ExtensionContext has no `settings` — but defended against future
    layered-settings SDKs).
  - Abuse-control keys (`server.rateLimitPerMin`, `maxConcurrent`,
    `maxPingpongTurns`, `replyTimeoutSec`) now stripped from repo settings,
    matching the env blocklist — a repo can no longer neuter rate limiting
    or the concurrency ceiling.
  - Repo-sourced peers never auto-attach the operator's shared token
    (the "known loopback peer" trust now requires an operator-configured
    source; prompt-injected `a2a_call(agent="helper")` to a repo-chosen
    loopback listener gets `auth: none`).
  - mDNS force-enable and card enrichment (`A2A_DISCOVERY_MDNS`,
    `A2A_ENRICH_CARD`, `discovery.mdns.enabled`, `discovery.enrichCard`)
    blocklisted from repo files (LAN/cwd/model disclosure).
  - README no longer recommends enabling the server via project-local
    `.pi/settings.json` (that path is now ignored for security keys).
  - Tests: ctx.settings injection, parent-dir `.env.local`, missing env
    blocklist keys, abuse-control strips, repo-peer no-auto-attach (plus
    operator-peer keeps-auto-attach regression), GET Host gate, `Origin: null`.

- **Repo-controlled `.pi/settings.json` is now sanitized (HIGH, completes #6):**
  the earlier fix only stripped security keys from repo `.env.local`; a
  malicious repo could still ship `.pi/settings.json` with
  `a2a.server.{enabled,host,sharedToken,peerTokens,trustedPeers,allowAllUsers,
  publicUrl}`, `a2a.discovery.{gateway,gateways}` (attacker gateway redirect),
  or `a2a.verifySsl:false`. Those paths are now stripped at read time from the
  repo-scope file only; operator-owned global settings and process env are
  unaffected. The config panel also no longer persists tokens into the
  repo-scope file (writes target operator-owned settings instead). Added
  `A2A_VERIFY_SSL` to the repo `.env.local` blocklist.
- **IPv6 loopback Host parsing (#7 follow-up):** `[::1]:9910` Host headers
  were mis-parsed to `"["` by `split(":")[0]` and falsely rejected with 403.
  Bracketed IPv6 is now split on `]` first; bare IPv6 compared whole.
- **Failure messages are redacted (#8 follow-up):** the FAILED task's
  `status.message` (error text can embed reply content) now passes through
  `redactOutbound()` like the reply artifact, before tasks/get or SSE
  returns it to a peer.

- **Inbound sessions now load host extension packages.** The task session
  runner created its `DefaultResourceLoader` with an in-memory
  `SettingsManager` that had no `packages` — the child session therefore ran
  WITHOUT any of the host's extension packages (pi-model-tools, pi-serena,
  …), silently disabling their hooks and tools. The loader now falls back to
  `SettingsManager.create(cwd, agentDir)` (the same path pi-subagent's runner
  uses), so inbound tasks behave like a real host session. This also fixes
  pi-model-tools' ds-anchor bootstrap, which never engaged in gateway-spawned
  sessions (observed: standard-like first thinking despite a pro model).
- **Inbound sessions inherit the host thinking level** instead of hardcoding
  `medium` (relevant for DeepSeek v4 Pro's minimal-mode recipe, which needs
  max thinking).
- **Gateway lifecycle lines no longer enter the LLM context.** `statusSink`
  routed `[a2a] registered…` / `gateway channel open…` through
  `pi.sendMessage`, and custom messages are converted to USER MESSAGES in the
  model context (buildSessionContext) — so every request was polluted with
  gateway noise, derailing DeepSeek v4 Pro's minimal-mode bootstrap (request
  #1 must be a clean user message). They now go through `ctx.ui.notify` only:
  still visible in the TUI as status lines, but never sent to the model.
  Headless modes (hasUI=false) fall back to stderr so the lifecycle stays
  observable (same pattern as `errorSink`).
- **Child sessions no longer auto-start an inbound A2A server.** The
  `session_start` auto-start is now guarded — SDK-created child sessions (a2a
  inbound tasks, pi-subagent children; hasUI=false + mode='print') would each
  construct their own A2AServer: same-pid registry overwrite, port climbing
  per task, duplicate gateway registration. Only host sessions serve inbound
  A2A (TUI/RPC via hasUI, and json-mode hosts via mode==='json').
- **Child sessions forward the host's project-trust decision** so project-
  local (`.pi/`) extensions load in inbound tasks when the user already
  trusted the project (matching pi-subagent's runner; never prompts).

- **Gateway diagnostics no longer interleave with lifecycle lines:**
  `[a2a-gateway] register failed …`, `channel dropped`, `dispatch failed`
  and other upstream/channel diagnostics used to print via raw
  `console.error`, rendering unstyled in the middle of the transcript right
  next to the `[a2a] registered…` / `[a2a] gateway channel open…` status
  lines. They now route to a dedicated error sink — a TUI error toast (a
  separate surface from the transcript status lines), falling back to stderr
  when headless. New optional `onError` hook on `A2AServer` wires it up.

### Added

- **Caller attribution to the gateway:** outbound calls routed through an
  a2a-switchboard (`peer.viaGateway`) now send `X-Gateway-Caller: <selfIdentity
  or gateway peer name>` so the gateway's dashboard/live log shows which peer
  made the call. Advisory display name only — the gateway strips it before
  forwarding and it is not an auth mechanism.
- **Per-peer caller tokens:** the gateway now issues a unique `caller_token`
  at `/register`; the overlay peers (`gw/<name>`) present it (instead of the
  shared token) for outbound `/peer/*` calls, so the gateway attributes them
  to this peer's name even without the header.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-08-15

Gateway configuration in /a2a-config + explicit enable/disable.

### Added

- **`discovery.gateway.enabled` flag:** the upstream a2a-switchboard registration
  is now explicitly toggleable. Defaults to `true` when `url`+`token` are both
  set and no explicit value exists (backward compatible with the implicit
  activation); explicit `enabled: false` disables registration entirely. New
  env var `A2A_GATEWAY_ENABLED`.
- **Gateway editor in /a2a-config:** a new Gateway panel group exposes the full
  settings.json block — registration toggle, URL, API token, peer name,
  upstream token, heartbeat (s), and reverse-channel toggle. Tokens render
  masked (`••••`) in the panel and inline-edit hints.
- **Persist gateway on edit:** the panel now writes `discovery.gateway` back to
  settings.json when a gateway field changed (env-sourced secrets are not
  copied on unrelated discovery edits).
- `/a2a-config show` now prints a gateway line (enabled/url/token-set).

### Fixed

- Live config overrides now merge `discovery.gateway` (previously dropped, so
  panel gateway edits could not apply without /reload).
- Server skips `startGatewayUpstream` when `enabled: false`.
- The reverse-channel "channel open" line now surfaces in the host transcript
  (`[a2a] gateway channel open (firewall-safe receive)`) like the registration
  message instead of raw console output in the chat window.
- **Reviewer fixes (persistence safety):** an existing `discovery.gateway`
  block in settings.json (enabled OR disabled) now survives unrelated panel
  edits byte-for-byte (discovery is merged, not replaced); a discovery-only
  edit no longer writes the full `server` block (env-sourced
  sharedToken/peerTokens stay out of settings.json); env-sourced gateway
  secrets are copied to disk only when the user edits that exact row; an
  empty submit on a masked secret row keeps the existing value instead of
  wiping it. Persistence logic extracted to `buildA2ASettingsPatch` and
  unit-tested.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-08-15

Discovery completeness + untruncated conversation view + gateway registration visibility.

- **Peer discovery shows ALL exposed tools:** `a2a_peers` / `/a2a-peers` previously capped the
  tool list at 8; now every advertised tool is listed (wrapped at 10 per line, matching the
  Agent Card metadata.tools). `a2a_discover` now also renders the full `Tools (N)` list from the
  card metadata (pi-session extension) instead of skills-only. Gateway peers surface their
  `caps=` tags.
- **Inbound messages are no longer truncated:** transcript lines carry the full task text and
  full assistant reply (previously capped at ~100-120 chars with a trailing …). Multiline text
  is preserved like a normal conversation turn; toasts stay short.
- **Gateway registration is visible in the transcript:** a successful a2a-switchboard registration
  now emits a `[A2A gateway] registered to … as …` line (plus toast) rendered like the
  `[A2A inbound]` activity lines, instead of being lost in console output.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-08-14

mDNS broadcast hostname-claim fix.

- **Fixed macOS hostname-rename conflict:** enabling mDNS advertising made
  `bonjour-service` publish A/AAAA records claiming the OS local hostname
  (its default when no `host` option is given), fighting macOS
  mDNSResponder's ownership → "This computer's local hostname … is already
  in use on this network" → the machine was renamed (e.g. `MBP-Sao-2.local`).
  Broadcasts now claim a unique per-session name
  (`<hostname>-a2a-<pid>.local`) that never equals the OS hostname, and the
  service instance name gets a pid suffix (`<agent>-<pid>`), so multiple Pi
  sessions on one machine no longer probe-collide on the same
  `<name>._a2a._tcp.local` fqdn.
- **Test-suite exit hang:** `npm test` could hang after a green run because the
  optional mDNS live-socket tests were always run (bonjour-service is a dev
  dep) and their sockets kept the event loop alive. They are now skipped by
  default (`MDNS_NETWORK_TESTS=1` opts in), so the suite exits naturally and
  leaks are still detected.
- **Restoring a pre-0.3.1 rename:** System Settings → General → Sharing
  (edit Name), or `sudo scutil --set LocalHostName <name>`.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-08-14

Inbound activity visibility + interactive config panel.

### Inbound activity in the host TUI

- When a remote peer sends Pi an A2A task, the host session now shows it:
  **arrival** (who sent it + task preview), **live progress** (tool calls and
  assistant text deltas from the isolated session, forwarded through the
  runner's `onProgress` channel), and **completion/failure** (state, elapsed,
  reply preview).
- Surfaced as **transcript messages** (`pi.sendMessage`, customType
  `a2a-inbound`) with a compact custom renderer, plus `notify()` toasts and a
  footer status line while tasks are in flight.
- New `a2a.ui.transcript` toggle (default `true`) — set `false` to keep only
  toasts + footer status and keep inbound activity out of the host LLM
  context. (Transcript messages become user-role context for the host agent;
  content is terse and `[A2A inbound]`-prefixed.)
- Server emits activity through an optional `onActivity` hook — fully
  testable, backward compatible (no hook = no UI, same as before).

### Interactive config panel

- `/a2a-config` now opens an **arrow-key config panel** (TUI mode) covering
  Server (enabled/port/host/agentName/timeouts/concurrency/rate-limit),
  Discovery (local registry/mDNS/enrich-card), Identity (selfIdentity), Peers
  (edit URLs, add/remove), and UI (transcript toggle).
- `/a2a-config show` (or non-TUI mode) prints the config summary as before.
- Saving persists to settings.json via a new `writeSettingsA2A` (read-modify-
  write, preserves unrelated keys, atomic rename) **and** applies live via
  in-memory overrides (`setConfigOverrides`) — no `/reload` needed. Server/
  discovery changes auto-restart the running inbound server.
- **Fixed panel runtime bugs** (0.3.0 patch): the panel no longer calls
  `ctx.ui.input()`/`confirm()`/`select()` while displayed — those open
  editor-container dialogs that render UNDER the overlay and fight overlay
  focus (symptoms: toggles not working, panel vanishing after typing a value,
  command unable to re-open). The panel now embeds its own inline `Input`
  component (empty prefill, old value shown as hint; Enter confirms, Esc
  cancels) and saves directly on Esc when dirty — the proven llama-extension
  single-component pattern. The component is also focusable (focused
  getter/setter) and scrolls rows (max 14 visible).
- **Fixed toggle-not-reflecting + width-crash** (0.3.0 patch 2): `row.set` now
  also updates `row.value` (stale value made toggles render "off" forever),
  and every rendered line is truncated to the overlay width via
  `truncateToWidth` (a long peer URL previously threw
  "Rendered line exceeds terminal width" and crashed Pi).
- New peer dep `@earendil-works/pi-tui` (panel component only).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-14

Session self-declaration + local discovery. Each Pi session running an inbound
A2A server now declares its identity (working folder, model, tools, pid, URL)
so other sessions can discover and delegate to the **right** peer without
port-scanning or manual config.

Three complementary layers, all opt-in and backward-compatible:

### Local file registry (zero-dep)

- Each session writes `<piDir>/a2a_registry/<pid>.json` with `{url, port, cwd,
  model, tools, sessionName, pid, mtime}`.
- Dual stale-entry GC: mtime TTL (default 60s) **and** `process.kill(pid,0)`
  liveness probe on every read → self-heals after crashes.
- Heartbeat rewrites the file every `heartbeatSec` (default 15). Timer is
  `unref`'d so it never blocks shutdown.
- New `a2a_peers` tool + `/a2a-peers` command list the merged peer set.
- `a2a_list` / `/a2a-agents` now append a "Discovered peers" section.

### Enriched Agent Card (standards-compliant)

- The Agent Card advertises an A2A v1.0 **Extension**
  (`https://bacnh85.dev/a2a/extensions/pi-session/v1`, `required: false`) plus
  a top-level `metadata` map with pid/cwd/model/tools/sessionName/startedAt.
- Any A2A peer (Pi or not, local or network) can read the session metadata
  directly from the card.
- Live model changes (`model_select` event) refresh the descriptor + card.

### mDNS / DNS-SD (optional dep)

- Broadcast + discover on `_a2a._tcp` for cross-machine LAN discovery.
- `bonjour-service` is an `optionalDependency`, dynamically imported with
  graceful no-op degrade when absent — the zero-dep baseline is preserved.
- TXT record carries url/cwd/model for screening without a card fetch.

### Config

New `a2a.discovery` block in `settings.json`:

```jsonc
"a2a": {
  "discovery": {
    "local": { "enabled": true, "heartbeatSec": 15, "ttlSec": 60 },
    "mdns":  { "enabled": false, "serviceType": "a2a" },
    "enrichCard": true
  }
}
```

New env vars: `A2A_DISCOVERY_LOCAL`, `A2A_DISCOVERY_MDNS`, `A2A_MDNS_TYPE`,
`A2A_HEARTBEAT_SEC`, `A2A_TTL_SEC`, `A2A_ENRICH_CARD`.

### Tests

109 → 141 (registry GC, card enrichment, discovery merge/dedupe, mDNS handle,
mdnsPeerKey dedup, clean/sanitization, self-exclusion, server
register/unregister lifecycle, local-disabled).

### Review-hardened (post-review fixes)

- **mDNS unbounded growth fixed** — added `down` handler + composite dedup key
  (`mdnsPeerKey`) so URL-less peers don't accumulate and departed peers are
  removed.
- **Prompt-injection defense** — discovery fields (name/cwd/tools) from
  untrusted sources (mDNS TXT, registry files) are sanitized via `clean()`
  (single-line, length-capped) before rendering to the model.
- **mDNS independent of local** — `startDiscovery` no longer gated behind
  `local.enabled`; descriptor built unconditionally so mDNS works standalone.
- **Self-exclusion** — `listPeers` accepts `selfUrl` so a session doesn't see
  itself as a delegation target.
- **Defensive `cfg.peers ?? {}`** in `listPeers` for hand-built configs.
- Validated with a live two-session mutual-discovery smoke test.

### Security hardening (second review round)

- **Credential exfiltration fixed (HIGH)** — the shared bearer token is now
  attached to loopback URLs ONLY when the URL is a *known* peer (configured
  `a2a.peers` or a live local-registry entry — same machine, same user). An
  arbitrary/prompt-injected `a2a_call("http://localhost:<port>")` sends NO
  Authorization header. mDNS peers are excluded (network-controllable).
- **IPv6 `::1` loopback** — `isLoopbackHost` now strips brackets before
  comparison (consistent with `isPrivateHost`), so `http://[::1]:port` works.
- `normUrl` exported from config (shared by resolvePeer + known-peer matching).
- Tests: 141 → 146 (known-loopback token attach, arbitrary-loopback no-token,
  non-loopback no-token, no-token-configured, IPv6 ::1).
- Live validation: `a2a_call` to a discovered registry peer (9911) succeeds
  with auto-attached token; arbitrary localhost port receives no token.

### Per-session identity (third round)

- **Unique caller attribution** — new `selfIdentity` config (env
  `A2A_SELF_IDENTITY`) names THIS session. When set, the outbound path presents
  `peerTokens[selfIdentity]` instead of the shared token, so the receiver's
  `authenticate()` attributes the call to a named session (not the anonymous
  `ip:` identity). Fixes the all-sessions-share-one-token problem: unique audit
  entries, per-session rate-limit buckets, and real `trustedPeers` allow-lists.
- Falls back to the shared token when `selfIdentity` is unset or has no
  `peerTokens` entry — backward compatible.
- The session descriptor + Agent Card now carry `selfIdentity` so peers know
  which token to present when calling this session.
- Sessions still reach each other: each presents its OWN token; the receiver's
  global `peerTokens` directory resolves the identity. No caller needs another
  session's token.
- Tests: 146 → 149 (own-token preference, shared fallback when identity absent,
  shared fallback when selfIdentity empty).

## 0.1.1 — 2026-08-13

Fix: A2A inbound server EADDRINUSE across concurrent Pi sessions.

- **Port fallback**: when the configured `a2a.server.port` is busy (another Pi
  session holds it), the inbound server now climbs to `port+1` … `port+10`
  (configurable via `a2a.server.portFallback` / `A2A_PORT_FALLBACK`), then
  falls back to an OS-assigned port — instead of failing with
  `listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use`.
- **Accurate Agent Card**: the card advertises the port the server *actually*
  bound, so peers can always call it back after a fallback.
- **Non-fatal auto-start**: `session_start` no longer shows a scary error toast
  when inbound serving can't start; it warns once and outbound `a2a_*` tools
  keep working.
- **Ephemeral port (0)**: explicit `a2a.server.port: 0` binds an OS-assigned
  port with no misleading "port was busy" note.
- **Stopped state**: `server.url` returns empty / `server.port` null after
  stop — no stale-port advertisement.
- **Docs**: README notes `a2a.server.enabled` is per-session; prefer
  project-local `.pi/settings.json` for a fixed port.
- Tests: 104 → 109 (fallback-to-next-port, OS-assigned exhaustion, card
  advertises real port, happy-path, explicit ephemeral port 0, empty url after
  stop). Typecheck clean.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-13

Initial release. A2A Protocol v1.0 bidirectional extension for the Pi coding agent.

**Review-hardened**: 3 adversarial review rounds (20 findings total, all fixed).
104 tests passing, clean typecheck, clean pack. Live interop verified against a
running Hermes A2A server (discover + call → reply).

### Outbound (always available)

Pi as an A2A Client — discover and delegate tasks to remote agents (Hermes,
Google ADK, LangChain, CrewAI, any A2A-compliant peer):

- **Tools:** `a2a_call`, `a2a_discover`, `a2a_list`, `a2a_history`, `a2a_orchestrate`
- **Commands:** `/a2a-discover`, `/a2a-agents`, `/a2a-send`, `/a2a-broadcast`,
  `/a2a-status`, `/a2a-config`, `/a2a-help`
- Multi-turn conversations via `context_id` (persisted to JSONL, survives
  compaction/restart)
- Capability-based fan-out (`a2a_orchestrate`): `all` / `first` / `best` modes

### Inbound (opt-in via `a2a.server.enabled`, default off)

Pi as an A2A Server — exposes itself as an A2A-discoverable agent:

- Agent Card at `GET /.well-known/agent-card.json` (legacy `agent.json` alias)
- JSON-RPC v1.0 methods: `message/send`, `message/stream` (SSE), `tasks/get`,
  `tasks/list`, `tasks/cancel`, `tasks/subscribe`; pre-1.0 path aliases accepted
- Each inbound task spawns an isolated Pi agent session (`createAgentSession`)
  in the configured workspace and returns the reply as a task artifact
- **Command:** `/a2a-server start|stop|status`

### Security (ported from Hermes)

- **Localhost-only by default** — remote exposure requires a token AND an
  explicit `a2a.server.host` opt-in
- Per-peer tokens (`A2A_PEER_TOKENS`) or shared bearer (`A2A_BEARER_TOKEN`)
- Constant-time token comparison; authenticated identity drives trust/rate-limiting
- **Outbound redaction** — credential-shaped strings (API keys, JWTs, bearer
  tokens, emails) scrubbed before sending to peers
- **Inbound injection filtering** — ChatML / role-prefix / override phrases
  defanged; inbound text framed as untrusted peer input
- Audit log (`<piDir>/a2a_audit.jsonl`); anti-loop turn cap per context

### Implementation

- Zero runtime dependencies — pure Node.js stdlib + global `fetch`
- A2A v1.0 wire format, tolerant of v0.3 peers (legacy `kind` Parts, `agent.json`)
- TypeScript extension, 90 mocha + tsx tests, clean typecheck
